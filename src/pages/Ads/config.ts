I am writing to request the unblocking of my Google Ads account, which was suspended due to circumvention policy.
I want to start by expressing my deep regret for any actions or practices that may have led to the suspension of my account. I understand that Google Ads has strict policies in place to protect the integrity of the platform and ensure a fair and safe experience for all users. I assure you that I am fully committed to complying with these policies moving forward.
I would appreciate any specific details or examples you could provide regarding the alleged violations, so that I can better understand the issues and take the necessary steps to correct them. I am also open to any suggestions or recommendations you may have for improving my account's compliance and performance.
I value the opportunity to use Google Ads to reach and engage with potential customers, and I believe that my business can benefit greatly from this platform. I hope that you will reconsider the suspension of my account and allow me to resume using Google Ads in a responsible and effective manner.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Shun Lv`
